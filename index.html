								<p><strong>Founded in 2019 by Udit Sharma in sophomore year of high school, StudyDost was inspired by a group of young children who wanted to go to school but couldn't because of the poor economic conditions in their family..<br>
						He therefore wished to extend the assistance he provides to them at his home to many it could benefit. Since then he has 
					organized and trained a team of high school students from his school and abroad via various social media platforms.<br>
				StudyDost is currently a proud organization of thirty five high school students who give academic help to those that are in want of it. </strong></p>
